          <h3>PhD Student</h3>
          <h4>Email: al979@scarletmail.rutgers.edu</h4>
          <p>Amanda designs ligand binders towards fluorogenic targets—aiming to produce a smaller alternative to the GFP family with better cell penetration and signal-to-noise ratio—and to visible targets. In light of the recent focus on banning synthetic food dyes by the FDA, she aims to design and produce affordable, high precision detectors to the banned food dyes, both in bound and free form.</p>

          <p>Nithai engineers haloalkane dehalogenases (DhaA) to enhance their stability in harsh environments for environmental detoxification. Using site-specific cysteine mutants, he conjugates polymers to DhaA31 and thermostable DhaA231 via SPAAC, improving thermal and solvent stability for bioremediation of pollutants like 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP).</p>

          <p>Priya's research focuses on understanding and modulating α-synuclein aggregation, a hallmark of Parkinson’s disease. She is currently probing the interactions between synuclein and engineered HtrA protease/PDZ domain variants, with the goal of identifying stronger binders that can inhibit toxic aggregation pathways. By combining biochemical assays with rational design, she aims to uncover strategies for developing anti-aggregation binders that could serve as leads for therapeutic intervention.</p>
